# The User Behavior Insights (UBI) Standard

The most important part of UBI is its standard that defines how queries and user events are defined. The UBI standard is maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/o19s/ubi).

UBI requires coordination between the client (a browser, a mobile app, etc.) and the backend, which is documented using UBI standard

The schema is documented by itself, but it's much easier to get "the big picture" with a graphical representation:
